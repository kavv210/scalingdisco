The School Management System is a comprehensive software solution 
designed to streamline and automate various administrative and academic tasks 
in an educational institution. This project aims to provide an efficient and user
friendly platform to manage key aspects of school operations, including student 
records, teacher management, library management, and fee payments. The 
system ensures better organization, data security, and enhanced productivity 
for both educators and administrative staff. 
The system's core modules are as follows: 
1. Student Management: 
This module handles student information, including admission details, 
attendance tracking, academic performance, and personal records. It 
enables administrators to efficiently manage student data and update it as 
required. 
2. Teacher Management: 
This feature allows the school administration to maintain detailed records 
of teachers, including their subjects, classes, and personal details. It 
simplifies the process of assigning teachers to various classes and tracking 
their schedules. 
3. Library Management: 
The library module manages book inventory, student borrowing records, 
and book return deadlines. This module helps librarians maintain an 
organized and easily accessible catalog, reducing manual errors and 
improving user experience. 
4. Fee Payment Management: 
This module facilitates the management of student fees, including fee 
collection, payment tracking, and generating receipts. It offers 
transparency and efficiency in handling school finances and enables 
parents to make payments conveniently.
